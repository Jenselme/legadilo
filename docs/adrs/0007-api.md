# 7 - API

* **Date:** 2024-10-26
* **Status:** Accepted

## Context

I’d like to build a browser extension to save articles and subscribe to feeds more easily directly on the page we are on.
I think it’s a pretty common feature of feed aggregators and links savers (mostly links savers to be honest).
We have two options:
* Build a proper API and make the browser extension use this API:
  * We have several possibilities to help us build the backend.
    DRF and Django Ninja being the two real pretenders.
    Since we have only a simple feature set and little times, I think Django Ninja is a better fit here: it’s easier to use and should allow us to develop the API faster.
    It’s also async compatible out of the box and based on Pydantic (a package I use at work) which we can reuse for other validation!
  * We will have to develop the API and dig a bit into how to do it properly with Django Ninja.
  * It will unlok other possibilities in the long run in how to use the app (mobile app, integration with 3rd parties…).
  * It should be easier to authenticate to the app: we can manage authentication differently and let the user configure the extension with an application token.
    We could let the cookies be transmitted and rely on that (not sure how it will behave though).
    And it makes the extension very tied to the connection to the app in the browser.
    Whereas normal flow in this case is to never be disconnected.
    Handling connection with MFA might be a problem too: we can’t display much in the extension and may have to redirect the user the app anyway to login.
    That would be a very poor UX.
  * It should also be easier to post and retrieve data to manipulate it as part of the browser extension.
* Call the standard views (ie the views that powers the app):
  * We will have to adapt how we manage CSRF tokens to be able to supply them to our views.
    It’s doable, I’ve done it in the past, but I always disliked it.
  * We will have to post data as form data.
    Not the cleanest way, but manageable.
    Having a view that accepts both JSON and form is too much of a hassle in bare Django for me to do that.
    And if I’m not building an API, there isn’t really a point into bringing a package just for that.
  * We will manipulate HTML.
    It may ease display (but I don’t think we will have anything fancy to display) at the cost of harder manipulations.
    And we won’t be able to use the "normal" templates since we won’t have the same display.
    This implies to make some views or templates even more complex.

I think it’s worth trying to develop the API and see how it goes.
If it’s not too much work, I think we should commit to it.

### Authentication

Auth: Django Ninja doesn’t provide anything out of the box to build an auth with tokens.
It does however allow us to protect endpoints, routers or the full API with authentication.
It also gives us the basic tooling to fetch a token from the `Authorization` header and validate it.
If it’s valid, access is granted to the endpoint, if not the user gets an error message.
Django Ninja also allows us to have a list of authentication methods to use, so we can use token based auth for the extension and cookie auth as usual to try stuff in the browser (and in tests).

How to create tokens to access the API?
The more secure and most flexible way is probably to rely on the OAuth2 standard.
As [the wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) states:

> OAuth (short for open authorization) is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.
> […]
> Generally, the OAuth protocol provides a way for resource owners to provide a client application with secure delegated access to server resources. It specifies a process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to their server resources without providing credentials.

It seems to fit exactly what we are trying to do.
*But* it’s also very complex with its scopes and its authorization flow.
From what I understand, we also need to supply the username and password to get the first refresh tokens.
So we would need to store the password in the extension (that’s what Wallabag does) and I don’t think it’s a good idea: I’d prefer not to need to copy/paste and then store passwords outside the app.
We propose MFA but most users won’t enable it and if the passwords leaks anyone could get access to their account from the extension.
It should also prevent the usage of only the password to authenticate: we’d need to ask for the MFA code to get a token too!
It’s probably more secure, but it’s also a pain to use.
We’d need yet another library to do this correctly.
*We need something more simple.*

After thinking about it some more and reading:
* We cannot rely on the true user password for this: this would either be painful or circumvent MFA for the API.
  We can rely like most apps on application tokens for that: they are dedicated to an app and thus can be revoked/changed way more easily.
* We don’t need refresh tokens: they are interesting to have short-lived access tokens that don’t need db queries so we can still revoke permissions to some users.
  We can afford db queries to check the validity of the access token (we are not at big scale).
* Regarding the application tokens:
  * We could create them from username and password.
    But as part of the extension, this would involve to store them as part of the configuration.
    I don’t think it’s desirable.
    It would also make working with MFA harder.
    And if the password needs to be changed, it would impact all consumers of the API.
  * I think it’s safer to have the user create application "passwords" like in many other apps and create the access tokens from that.
    These applications passwords would kind of act as a refresh token.
  * These passwords won’t be transmitted much over the network: we will transmit them only to get an access token.
    They can be revoked easily from the user profile without impacting anything else.
    We should be able to give them an expiration date just in case.

## Decisions

* We will build the API with Django Ninja.
* We will authenticate to the API with application tokens that will be used to create an actual access token usable to access the API.
  They will:
  * Be a long random string stored in the database generated with the `secrets` module.
    This secret will be hashed so db admins can’t access them nor hackers if our database leaks.
    They will thus only be visible to the user at creation to prevent stealing.
  * Have an optional expiration date.
    If unset, they are valid until manually deleted.
* The access tokens:
  * Will be created from the application token UUID (no enumeration attack this way), username (to ease identify to whom the token is linked to) and of course the secret. 
  * Can have a relatively long validity period.
  * Will be checked against their corresponding application token.
    If the application token is deleted or expired, the access token will be rejected.
  * Will be in the JWT format and will contain the UUID of the application token used to generate it and will contain the id of the user to use.
    This will enable us to store and validate the token using well a known format with well known libraries. 


## Consequences

* Let’s use Pydantic instead of JSON schemas to validate our JSON model fields and the data we read from external sources.
  This will help us limit the number of libraries we use.
  At this stage, I think Pydantic is a safe choice: it’s well known and maintained.
  It’s also used a lot in the community nowadays and has become very popular.
* The API won’t allow all capabilities in the first time to gain time.
  We will develop first and foremost what we need for the extension.
* We already unlock some API usage for everybody!
  We will improve it later as part of https://github.com/Jenselme/legadilo/issues/320.
* The API will be documented more or less automatically and browsable thanks to Swagger.
* In the long run, we may have to switch to oauth for our tokens.
