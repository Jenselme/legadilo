# 7 - API

* **Date:** 2024-10-26
* **Status:** Accepted

## Context

I’d like to build a browser extension to save articles and subscribe to feeds more easily directly on the page we are on.
I think it’s a pretty common feature of feed aggregators and links savers (mostly links savers to be honest).
We have two options:
* Build a proper API and make the browser extension use this API:
  * We have several possibilities to help us build the backend.
    DRF and Django Ninja being the two real pretenders.
    Since we have only a simple feature set and little times, I think Django Ninja is a better fit here: it’s easier to use and should allow us to develop the API faster.
    It’s also async compatible out of the box and based on Pydantic (a package I use at work) which we can reuse for other validation!
  * We will have to develop the API and dig a bit into how to do it properly with Django Ninja.
  * It will unlok other possibilities in the long run in how to use the app (mobile app, integration with 3rd parties…).
  * It should be easier to authenticate to the app: we can manage authentication differently and let the user configure the extension with an application token.
    We could let the cookies be transmitted and rely on that (not sure how it will behave though).
    And it makes the extension very tied to the connection to the app in the browser.
    Whereas normal flow in this case is to never be disconnected.
    Handling connection with MFA might be a problem too: we can’t display much in the extension and may have to redirect the user the app anyway to login.
    That would be a very poor UX.
  * It should also be easier to post and retrieve data to manipulate it as part of the browser extension.
* Call the standard views (ie the views that powers the app):
  * We will have to adapt how we manage CSRF tokens to be able to supply them to our views.
    It’s doable, I’ve done it in the past, but I always disliked it.
  * We will have to post data as form data.
    Not the cleanest way, but manageable.
    Having a view that accepts both JSON and form is too much of a hassle in bare Django for me to do that.
    And if I’m not building an API, there isn’t really a point into bringing a package just for that.
  * We will manipulate HTML.
    It may ease display (but I don’t think we will have anything fancy to display) at the cost of harder manipulations.
    And we won’t be able to use the "normal" templates since we won’t have the same display.
    This implies to make some views or templates even more complex.

I think it’s worth trying to develop the API and see how it goes.
If it’s not too much work, I think we should commit to it.

## Decisions

The test is a success and I think I achieved something good.
Let’s commit the API with Ninja!

### Tokens and API protection

Auth: Django Ninja doesn’t provide anything out of the box to build an auth with tokens.
It does however allow us to protect endpoints, routers or the full API with authentication.
It also gives us the basic tooling to fetch a token from the `Authorization` header and validate it.
If it’s valid, access is granted to the endpoint, if not the user gets an error message.
Django Ninja also allows us to have a list of authentication methods to use, so we can use token based auth for the extension and cookie auth as usual to try stuff in the browser (and in tests).

How to create tokens to access the API?
* We could create them from username and password.
  But as part of the extension, this would involve to store them as part of the configuration.
  I don’t think it’s desirable.
  It would also make working with MFA harder.
  And if the password needs to be changed, it would impact all consumers of the API.
* I think it’s safer to have the user create application "passwords" like in many other apps and create the access tokens from that.
  These applications passwords would act as a refresh token.
* These passwords won’t be transmitted much over the network: we will transmit them only to get an access token.
  They can be revoked easily from the user profile without impacting anything else.
  We should be able to give them an expiration date just in case.
* They may be transmitted a bit too much and I may be relying too much on my knowledge to build this.
  Not a problem right now, but I’ll have to recheck all this when I have more time.
  Right now, I think it’s safe enough for myself.

### Summary

* We will build the API with Django Ninja.
* We will authenticate to the API with application tokens that will be used to create an actual access token usable to access the API.
  They will:
  * Be a long random string stored in the database generated with the `secrets` module.
  * Be visible to the user only at creation to prevent stealing.
  * Have an optional expiration date.
    If unset, they are valid until manually deleted.
* The access tokens:
  * Will be relatively short-lived to prevent attacks if it leaks.
  * Will be in the JWT format and will contain the name of the application token used to generate it (mostly for debug purpose) and will contain the id of the user to use.
    This will enable us to store and validate the token using well a known format with well known libraries. 


## Consequences

* Let’s use Pydantic instead of JSON schemas to validate our JSON model fields and the data we read from external sources.
  This will help us limit the number of libraries we use.
  At this stage, I think Pydantic is a safe choice: it’s well known and maintained.
  It’s also used a lot in the community nowadays and has become very popular.
* The API won’t allow all capabilities in the first time to gain time.
  We will develop first and foremost what we need for the extension.
* We already unlock some API usage for everybody!
  We will improve it later as part of https://github.com/Jenselme/legadilo/issues/320.
* The API will be documented more or less automatically and browsable thanks to Swagger.
* We should dig further to make sure our model is secured.
  This is not a problem *right now* since we don’t have users, but can become in the future.
  I’m mostly thinking of [Wallabag](https://doc.wallabag.org/en/developer/api/oauth) which has a different way to handle tokens.
